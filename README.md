## Development

The project is set up to use ddev, or you can use the built-in Laravel server.

### ddev

With ddev you shouldn't have to edit .env.

1. Start ddev
```
ddev start
```

2. Run database migrations:
```bash
ddev exec php artisan migrate
```

3. Start the Vite development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Laravel server

1. Spin up your database and enter the details into `.env`.

2. Start the Laravel development server:
```bash
php artisan serve
```

2. Run database migrations:
```bash
php artisan migrate
```

3. Start the Vite development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production Deployment

1. Set your production environment variables in `.env`

2. Optimise Laravel:
```bash
php artisan config:cache
php artisan route:cache
php artisan view:cache
```

3. Build your frontend assets:
```bash
npm run build
```

4. Configure cron to run this command every minute (or at least every 5 minute), which will clear out expired passwords:
```
php artisan schedule:run
```
