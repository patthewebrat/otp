    <p><strong>How it works:</strong> This app uses AES-GCM-256 based client-side encryption to securely share files that self-destruct after download. Neither the unencrypted file or the encryption key are ever sent to our servers. Only the encrypted file is stored on our secure servers.</p>
    <p><strong>About:</strong> <a href="https://indulge.digital/blog/i-built-password-sharing-tool-ai-and-here%E2%80%99s-what-i-learnt" target="_blank">Learn about why this tool exists</a>.</p>
    <p><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> While we strive to ensure security, we do not guarantee that files cannot be intercepted or misused. Use at your own risk.</p>
    <p><strong>Privacy:</strong> This site does not use cookies, analytics, or tracking tools beyond essential server logs (IP address, URL, timestamp). Files are encrypted before transmission and storage on our servers. The data is only used to provide the file to those you choose to share the link with, and for no other purpose. All stored files are deleted in full from our servers once they have been downloaded, or once they have expired.</p>
